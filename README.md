## Predicting_Protien_Thermostability
I will be using this repository while learning data preparation - EDA and Feature extraction.
Dataset is copied from the kaggle competition - Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction.

This notebook was a 'get messy real fast' trial to participate in the competition - https://www.kaggle.com/code/rzachariah/gemme-catboost?scriptVersionId=115345757.

I am now working through the posts and notebooks shared by various participants as I apply 'Design Thinking' principles to explore the data, make sense of it, and extract features of interest.
